"conf" folder includes property files. Its reference is in "TrustModelWeights.java" file.
The file might be subject to change. Don't forget the reference in that case.
conf/TrustModel.properties and Properties/TrustModel.properties are the same!
Figure out which one is referenced!

"getrelevantlines.py" sucks!!!

Modified_dblp_example is being referenced. Migrated just in case.

"splitfiles.py" WTF?
